# (WIP) WeatherDrivenSolarPanel

## Introduce

In the stock version of Kerbal Space Program, the energy output of solar panels is affected by direct sunlight, being blocked by terrain, being blocked by satellites, and being blocked by other parts. With the release of blackrackâ€™s [True Volumetric Clouds](https://www.patreon.com/blackrack/posts), there is now another way to change energy output --- ***weather***. <br><br>This plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with True Volumetric Clouds. When you encounter rain, snow, dust storms, or volcanic clouds on a planet, you will notice a wonderful change in the values on the panel. Enjoy the game to the fullest!


## Dependencies

- [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus)
- [True volumetric clouds](https://www.patreon.com/blackrack/posts)
- [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/50533-18x-112x-module-manager-423-july-03th-2023-fireworks-season/)

## Installation
- The installation process is the same as other mods. Just put the WeatherDrivenSolarPanel folder from GameData into the GameData in the game root directory.

## To-Do List
- Add support for cloudy and overcast skies.
- Although it has now been realised that solar panels change their energy output in some weather conditions, this current implementation is not very perfect and other computational models will be considered in the future.

## Warning
- Compatibility with kerbalism remains to be seen.

## Others
- Due to the inscrutable calculation method of the stock version of EC resources, I am directly using the calculation method under the multi-star mode of Kopernicus here, which is currently the best method I can take.

## Credits
[@R-T-B](https://github.com/R-T-B)      Part of the Kopernicus code was used.
<br>[@LGhassen](https://github.com/LGhassen)      Thank him for bringing the commendable volumetric cloud mod to KSP.
<br> **Thanks to both of them for their help with this plugin!**
